        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Sparky application ("App") operated by Sparky ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        
        <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>
        
        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>
        
        <h2>App Content and User Data</h2>
        
        <p>Our App allows users to create and store personal relationship information, activities, and other content ("User Content"). You retain all rights to your User Content and are responsible for it, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.</p>
        
        <p>By submitting User Content to the App, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, and process this content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's services.</p>
        
        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account.</p>
        
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the credentials that you use to access the App and for any activities or actions under your account.</p>
        
        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        
        <p>Some parts of the App are provided on a subscription basis ("Premium Features"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring basis depending on the subscription plan you select.</p>
        
        <p>Subscription auto-renewal may be turned off from your device's account settings after purchase. No refund will be provided for the unused portion of any subscription period.</p>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to change subscription pricing, with reasonable notice to subscribers. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period.</p>
        
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        
        <p>In no event shall Sparky, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of significant changes through the App. What constitutes a significant change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        
        <p>By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>
        
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Sparky operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
