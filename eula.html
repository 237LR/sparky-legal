        <h2>5. Termination</h2>

        <p>The App may enable access to Sparky's and third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "Services"). Use of the Services may require internet access and that you accept additional terms of service. You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Services at your sole risk and that Sparky shall not have any liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>
        
        <h2>7. NO WARRANTY</h2>
        
        <p>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.
